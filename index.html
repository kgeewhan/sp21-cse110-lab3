            <h3>Slow Day</h3>
            <p class="entryp">
                Today, I woke up very tired feeling the aftermath of the chaotic
                weekend. I felt like I should have been used to the new schedule after
                the first week of classes but I for sure wasn't. I had to wake up at least 
                2 hours earlier than usual due to having to take morning classes this quarter.
                After taking my morning class, <span>I remember going right back to sleep.</span> I think 
                took an <b>hour</b> nap and when I woke up, it was around 12. I ate lunch and then 
                went on to start doing my homework for my classes. <span>Then around 6, I did my
                    daily workout, had dinner, and went back to working on homework.</span> <i>I was 
                so tired at this point.</i> I just turned on lofi music with rain in order
                to try to focus on finishing the assignment today. 
                To be honest, today was just another day. Nothing special happening. <br><br><br>

            <h3>Slow Day Pt. 2</h3>
            <p class="entryp">
                <em>Another morning, another class.</em> Today, I had to wake up even earlier than
                yesterday. However, I think it was much better since I was coming off of a Monday
                rather than the weekend. This is always a problem for me. On the weekends, I tend
                to wake up way later than the weekdays. Therefore, my schedule gets messed up where
                I have to readjust to my weekday schedule after weekends. But oh well. Similar to yesterday,
                I just powered through the day. After today's CSE 110 lecture, for some reason I was just
                inspired to look through CS memes. After looking through some channels in slack, I found one
                that I thought was pretty funny. That meme definitely made my day.

            <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
            <p class="entryp">
                <strong>Lab day!</strong> Today, the lab for CSE 110 released. According to the lab, we have to
                use HTML in order to create a journal page to record entries for the past 3 days.
                I have never used HTML before so I was a little bit confused going into the lab. 
                However, the tutorials that was listed on the lab page was very helpful for a 
                beginner like me in learning HTML. It looks like it may take a while for me to 
                complete the lab as well as everything I have to do for the rest of the week. I 
                need to make sure I plan out my schedule well enough to complete everything on time.
                <br>Here is my list of things I have to do within this week:
                <br>
            </p>
